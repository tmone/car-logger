- Introduction for testing ODB2 dataset ()
+ Generate random 4 type car ( 100 test result/ car) each 4 error type (normal, sensor_dropout, noise_spike, signal_drift).
 Each result test has above 6000 rows.
+ Dataset split 3 sub-dataset (train: 80%, validate: 10%, test: 10%)
- Training train dataset: (Each car type train 10 epochs - 2 minutes)
- Validating with validate dataset 
- Using model to predict all test dataset
